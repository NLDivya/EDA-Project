# EDA-Project
This project was done to check if a loan applicant is a defaulter or not.
Here, I have used Data Visualization to check if the loan takers in a Particular Finance company will be able to repay the loan or not.
Exploratory Data Analysis technique has been used. 
Once the two datasets have been read, the data has been cleaned
The missing values and Outliers have been identified and handled
Top 10 Corelations for defaulters have been idnetified
This analysis can be used by the company for Portfolio and Risk assesment.
